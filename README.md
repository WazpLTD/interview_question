# Interview coding question

This is a flask app that pulls a cat fact from a remote api and displays it as simple html.

### Please consider the following three questions:

- How would you improve/change the route that pulls the cat fact from the remote api and renders it as html?
- How would you implement a route that allows the user to download the cat fact as a PDF.
- How would you change the one unit test and what other unit tests would you write.
